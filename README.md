This is the github repository for the research paper 'Light-Weight Cinematic mode using Foveation with Optical flow and Autofocusing'. We aim at implementing the light-weight version of Apple's Cinematic Mode using video foveation, object detection and optical flow.

We did this work as part of the coursework for "Image and Video Processing" taught by Prof. Sumohana Channappayya at IIT Hyderabad.
